# 🌟 Event Management System  
**C (Doubly Linked List) + Python Flask + HTML/CSS**

An algorithm-driven Event Management System that demonstrates efficient data handling using a **Doubly Linked List in C**, seamlessly integrated with a modern **Flask-based web interface**.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project manages events through core operations such as **insertion, deletion, modification, searching, and sorting**, while also supporting **upcoming event tracking** and **conflict detection**.  
The distinguishing factor is that the **entire business logic is implemented in C**, not Python, ensuring low-level control over memory and data traversal. Flask is used strictly as an interface layer.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Apply **Doubly Linked Lists** in a practical, real-world system  
- Integrate **C backend logic** with a **web frontend**
- Prevent duplicate events and detect scheduling conflicts
- Build a clean, evaluable academic mini-project

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Used

- Doubly Linked List (dynamic memory allocation)
- Bidirectional traversal
- Algorithmic sorting and searching
- Flask routing and subprocess communication
- Frontend–backend decoupling

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔹 Event Operations
- Insert new events with autogenerated Event IDs
- Search events by Event ID
- Modify event details
- Delete events
- Display events sorted by date

### 🔹 Smart Enhancements
- Unique Event ID generation
- Duplicate event detection (same name, location, and date)
- Nearby event conflict warning (±2 days)
- Upcoming events live ticker
- Sorting by date or seat availability

### 🔹 UI/UX
- Modern responsive interface
- Animated background slideshow
- Sticky navigation bar
- Dedicated informational pages (Problem, Unique, Application)
